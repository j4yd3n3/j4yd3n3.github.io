Hello! I'm Jayden, a Computer Science student at San Diego State University focused on understanding how systems fail and how to defend them.

This site is my workspace for CTF writeups, projects, and anything I find interesting.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/j4yd3n3) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayden-dy/).
